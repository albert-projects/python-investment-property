<p>This project employs multithreading in Python to efficiently scrape property data from two prominent sources: <a href="https://www.propertyvalue.com.au/">Property Value</a> and <a href="https://sqmresearch.com.au/">SQM Research</a>. The scraped data is then stored into a SQLite database for easy access and manipulation.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Multithreading:</strong> Utilizes Python’s multithreading capabilities to enhance the speed and efficiency of the scraping process, enabling faster data retrieval.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Sources:</strong> Extracts property data from two major sources in the Australian real estate domain - Property Value and SQM Research.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SQLite Database:</strong> Stores the scraped property data into a SQLite database, ensuring structured and organized storage for easy retrieval and management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Integration:</strong> Integrates Python scripting with SQLite and Microsoft Excel reporting techniques, facilitating seamless data handling and reporting functionalities.</p>
</li>
